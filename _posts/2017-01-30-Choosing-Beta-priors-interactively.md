Choosing Beta prior distributions can be difficult when using the default parameterisation because the shape parameters are difficult to interpret. To get around this, Iâ€™ve written a simple `rshiny` app for teaching purposes, where the user can play with sliders to change the mean and spread of a Beta distribution and visualise the shape at the same time.  Of course, the app translates the mean and spread back to alpha and beta parameters so that once a good prior has been found, it can be implemented in R.
