I’ve put together a simple `rshiny` app [https://alastairrushworth.shinyapps.io/variogram/](https://alastairrushworth.shinyapps.io/variogram/) for visualising the effects of the nugget, range and sill parameters on a spatial process simulated under the exponential model.     I’m hoping that these types of things will be useful as teaching tools.  I have still to figure out how to add a colour legend to the image without using layout – this seems to interfere with par’s `mfrow`.  R shiny is great – there are lots of nice shiny examples here [www.showmeshiny.com](www.showmeshiny.com).
