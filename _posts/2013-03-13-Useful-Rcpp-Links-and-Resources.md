Recently I’ve working with `Rcpp` in order to make MCMC run more quickly, and it is fantastic. As a native R programmer, much of the effort has been in getting up to speed with writing in C++, but this is really eased by the features of Rcpp. There is already plenty of documentation available, primarily on Dirk Eddelbuettel’s website
[http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code.html](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code.html) and on the R package CRAN page [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)

But I thought I'd highlight some resources that got me quickly using `C++` in R via `Rcpp` from a standing start:

Very accessible (from an R programmers perpective) tutorial by Hadley Wickham

Google Tech talk by Dirk Eddelbuettel

Really helpful practical examples
