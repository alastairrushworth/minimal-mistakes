I am a data scientist interested in the development and application of statistical machine learning models.  I have particular expertise in the use of Bayesian methods, time series, advanced regression, semiparametric and random effect models.  I am also a very keen user of R.

I have a background in statistics and prior to my current role, spent two years as a lecturer in statistics at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/mathematicsstatistics/), and two years as a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/).  I have a PhD in statistics, and the research activity in previous roles focussed on developing spatio-temporal models for environmental applications.  A publications list is available [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rQUGb5UAAAAJ&hl=en).
