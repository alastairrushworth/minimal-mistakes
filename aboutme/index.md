I am a data scientist working in financial services with a background in statistical research.  I have wide ranging technical experience in supervised and unsupervised statistical machine learning, with particular expertise in the use of predictive modelling, Bayesian statistical modelling, time series analysis and generalised additive modelling.  I'm a very keen user of R and  have authored several R packages, some of which you can find on [Github](https://github.com/alastairrushworth).  

Prior to my current role, I spent two years as a lecturer in statistics at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/mathematicsstatistics/), and two years as a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/).  A full publications list is available  [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rQUGb5UAAAAJ&hl=en).
