I am a data scientist working in financial services with a background in statistical research.  I have wide ranging technical experience in statistical machine learning, with particular expertise in predictive modelling, anomaly detection, Bayesian statistical modelling, time series analysis and generalised additive modelling.  I'm a _very_ keen user of R and have written several R packages, some of which you can find on [Github](https://github.com/alastairrushworth).  I am author and instructor for the DataCamp course [Anomaly Detection in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/anomaly-detection-in-r). 

Prior to working in data science I spent two years as a lecturer in statistics at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/mathematicsstatistics/), and two years as a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/).  A publications list can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rQUGb5UAAAAJ&hl=en) and preprints and selected presentations [can be found here](https://alastairrushworth.github.io/papers/).
